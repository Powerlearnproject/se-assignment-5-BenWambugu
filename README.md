Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type >File: New File or >Explorer: New Folder. To open existing files, click on them in the Explorer view, or use File > Open File from the menu, or the Ctrl+O shortcut. You can also drag and drop files and folders into the editor from your file system. To manage files, use right-click options in the Explorer view, such as rename, delete, or move to a different folder.

   Use Ctrl+P to quickly open the "Quick Open" dialog, where you can type the name of a file to open it instantly. Navigate between open files using Ctrl+Tab or by clicking on the file tabs in the editor. To move between different parts of your code, use the breadcrumbs feature at the top of the editor, or Ctrl+Shift+O to jump to symbols within a file. The integrated file search (Ctrl+Shift+F) helps you locate specific text across all files in your workspace, and the built-in terminal allows you to run file and directory commands without leaving VS Code. These features collectively enhance the navigation and management of files, streamlining your development workflow.
